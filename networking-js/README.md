# Overview

My Networking is a basic application inspired on educational/professional platforms. This desktop application allows to understand more about local storage usage, dom manipulation, DOM structures with CSS, and learn more about functions and built-in functions with JS documentation. JavaScript allows me to make dynamic web pages with dynamic information that can be adapt from mock data to a real endpoint. Understanding how to work with data locally or using JSON to display data from local is a key part of this project. The purpose of this application is to understand the basics of dynamic web development in a real scenario, creating user interfaces, managing user data, and interactive features such a posting, deleting a post, and updating your profile, connecting with others.

# Development Environment

JavaScript, HTML, CSS

JavaScript is used to create dynamic and interactive webs, allowing me to manipulate DOM, handle user events and data stored in local storage. Also, I used HTML to structure the content of the web and CSS to style it to create a friendly interface.

# Future Work
In order to improve this app:

- Likes, reactions, and comments on posts
- Complete user profile, asking more information
- User Authentication to implement a secure login and registration so each profile is unique, and respecting user's privacy
- Backend integration (Node.js or Firebase) to store data instead of using localStorage
- Better UI
