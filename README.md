# Overview

This program is a simple demonstration of programming concepts. This program is created to understand basic functions, displaying a greeting message to the console. The goal is to practice creating well-documented and maintainable code.

The program prints a "Hello, World!" to the console, which can be modified the word "world" to print any word, making it a good example to begin learning functions in Python.

The main purpose of creating this software is to set a starting point as a developer with good documentation and version control using Git.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using Visual Studio Code (IDE) on my laptop (Windows). Git was used for version control. 

This program is using Python 3. I chose Python because it is clear and concise, it's perfect for beginners or experienced developers.
